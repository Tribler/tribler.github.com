The SwarmPlayer Browser plug-in (SwarmPlugin) is a media player plug-in for
Internet Explorer (Firefox and Safari in the next future) based on
the VLC plug-in. The SwarmPlugin incorporates P2P technology
(from now on P2P Core or Core) developed by TUDelft University, Vrije Universiteit, and others.
The advantages of integrating P2P networks and VideoOnDemand (from now
on VOD) should be known and are not going to be discussed here. This
document presents the architecture from a general and an in depth
point of view. Since the current status of the Plug-in is under
development, I'll give some attention on how to reproduce a building
and installation environment.

<h1 id="Architecture">Architecture</h1>
<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
As it's possible to see from the following picture, the general
architecture is composed by two main components:
</p>
<ul><li>The Background Process (from now on BG Process or BG)
</li><li>The Plug-in its-self
</li></ul><p>
The BG Process is intended to provide P2P download and streaming
functionalities to the Plug-in while the Plug-in is responsible for handling
the playback and the user interaction. It's easy to understand that
the architecture has been modeled as a client/server architecture
where the Plug-in is the client and the BG is the server.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 id="Plug-inBGProcessinteraction">Plug-in / BG Process interaction</h2>
<p>
The BG and the Plug-in communicate through two main channels:
</p>
<ul><li>A TCP channel for commands
</li><li>A HTTP channel for video steaming
</li></ul><p>
The TCP connection is used by the plug-in to send requests to the
BG, and by the BG Process to send commands to the Plug-in. The
communication protocol is really basic:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Plug-in requests:</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>"PLAY torrent_url.torrent"<br />
es: "PLAY <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.vuze.com/download/XUGIN6PEJJCQ5777C3WUMMBRFI6HYIHJ.torrent"><span class="icon">​</span>http://www.vuze.com/download/XUGIN6PEJJCQ5777C3WUMMBRFI6HYIHJ.torrent</a>" <br />
Ask to the BG to download the (video) content contained in the torrent file.
</li><li>"SHUTDOWN"<br />
Ask to the BG to shutdown the service (not the server) and close
command and stream connections (end of the plug-in session).
</li></ul><blockquote>
<p>
<strong>BG Process commands:</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>"PLAY stream_source" <br />
es: "PLAY <a class="ext-link" href="http://127.0.0.1:1678"><span class="icon">​</span>http://127.0.0.1:1678</a>" <br />
This command tells to the Plug-in that the requested video is
available on the specified stream_source.
</li><li>"PAUSE"<br />
This command tells to the Plug-in that the connection speed has
decreased and the P2P core needs some time for buffering.
</li><li>"RESUME"<br />
The buffer is full and the connection speed is good enough
to start again the playback previously paused.
</li><li>"SHUTDOWN"<br />
Acknowledge the Plug-in that the shutdown request has been
received and performed.
</li><li>"INFO info_string" <br />
es: "INFO Buffering 10%"<br />
This commands tells to the Plug-in that there's a string to display
in the playback region handled by Vlc.
</li></ul><p>
Here is shown an interaction scheme between Plug-in / BG / P2P Core:

</p>
<h2 id="TheBackgroundProcess">The Background Process</h2>
<h3 id="Overview1">Overview</h3>
<p>
The BG Process is a Windows executable (.exe) build up from python
sources. As already said it's basically a server providing VOD (and
P2P) features. The plug-in must be able to launch the BG Process
in the case the BG is not up yet. After the BG has been launched by
the first plug-in instance, it should keep serving in background until a manual
shutdown is performed (through the Systray Icon). The reason to keep
the BG alive is of course to guarantee seeding time after service
(video streaming) consumption. Through the systray icon it's possible to
interact with the BG Process, setting the upload rate limit, monitoring the
current download status and speed and requesting the BG to shutdown.
An alternative could be to provide interactivity/monitoring features to the
BG Process through a web interface.
</p>
<h2 id="ThePlug-in">The Plug-in</h2>
<h3 id="Overview2">Overview</h3>
<p>
The Plug-in is an ActiveX control based on the VLC Internet
Explorer plug-in (vlc-0.9.5). When the browser renders the
web page and an <tt> &lt;object&gt; </tt> tag is found in the html
code, the browser loads the plug-in associated to the
"classid" parameter of that tag. In our case the "classid" is
"E23FE9C6-778E-49D4-B537-38FCDE4887D8". Further studies
are needed to understand how to generate and register a new CLASSID
to be associated to the SwarmPlugin (since the current one is associated
to the VLC plug-in)
</p>
<p>
As soon as the Plug-in is loaded in the browser, a connection with
the BG Process is established and the communication between the two
components starts. If the Plug-in can not connect to the BG Process,
it tries to launch a new BG instance and to connect again. At this
point the connection is established and the session between Plug-in
and BG starts.
</p>
<p>
As already said the communication protocol between the two
components consists on requests (from Plug-in to BG) and commands
(from BG to Plug-in). This mechanism is asynchronous, this means
that after the Plug-in sends a request, commands can be received
anytime.
</p>
<p>
The interaction between the user and the Plug-in is identical to the
Vlc plug-in. For details refer to the Vlc documentation:<br />
<a class="ext-link" href="http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=blob;f=projects/activex/README.TXT"><span class="icon">​</span>http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=blob;f=projects/activex/README.TXT</a> <br />
<a class="ext-link" href="http://wiki.videolan.org/ActiveX"><span class="icon">​</span>http://wiki.videolan.org/ActiveX</a>
</p>
<h3 id="Sources">Sources</h3>
<p>
The starting point of the Plug-in development is vlc-0.9.5. The
source code of the VLC package contains a 'projects/activex' directory where
the code for building the 'axvlc.dll' is stored. This library is the
plug-in its self and is the one that is loaded into the browser.
</p>
<p>
The ActiveX control is composed by several files implementing
different features of an activex control. The 'main' files are
plugin.h, plugin.cpp. These are the only 2 files patched to let the
plug-in communicate with the BG Process. The patch consist in adding
a TriblerControl object to the VLCPlugin class. We are going to see
what does this means by giving an overview of the few classes
involved:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>VLCPlugin</strong>
This class implements the IUnknown interface of the ActiveX
control. The VLCPlugin is responsible for handling the region of
the web page where the VLC instance is going to draw the video
playback. This class has been extended by adding a TriblerControl
and some callback functions to provide the plug-in with P2P features.
</li></ul><ul><li><strong>TriblerControl</strong>
This class handles the communication protocol with the BG. Through
this class is possible to add VOD P2P functionality to any
software. It's important to introduce two concepts to understand
the functionalities of the TriblerControl: <br />
EventCBMap: this is a multimap containing the association between
the command received from the BG and the callback function to
perform. <br />
EventThread: this thread provides an asynchronous mechanism to the
communication protocol between Plug-in and BG. As soon as a
command is received, the EventThread looks in the EventCBMap and it
performs the action associated to the received command (see architecture
picture).

<h3 id="Runtimeenvironment">Runtime environment</h3>
<p>
The runtime environment is not completely defined yet. It's
reasonable to think that the installation path will be something
like <tt> C:Program FilesSwarmPlugin </tt>
</p>
<p>
it will contain the BGProcess executable and libraries, the Plug-in
(axvlc.dll) and the Vlc libraries. One registry entry will be
needed: <br />
<tt> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareSwarmPlugin </tt> <br />
<tt> BGProcessPath=C:Path        oBG </tt>
</p>
<p>
this item will contain the path through which the Plug-in can find
the BGProcess and run it.
</p>
<h1 id="Howtobuild">How to build</h1>
<h2 id="BackgroundProcess">Background Process</h2>
<p>
To build the BG Process you have to check out the svn repository: <br />
<tt> svn co http://svn.tribler.org/abc/branches/mainbranch/</tt>
</p>
<p>
go in the <em>mainbranch</em> directory just created and run on the console: <br />
<tt> python TriblerPluginBuildWin32setupBGexe.py py2exe </tt>
</p>
<p>
this requires you to have python and the py2exe extension installed.
Once done, you can find the <em>dist</em> directory containing the BG Process
executable and libraries.
</p>
<h2 id="Plug-in">Plug-in</h2>
<p>
As already mentioned, the Plug-in is a patched version
of the VLC (0.9.5) plug-in. VLC is software native for Linux, so to
build up a Windows version you'll have to cross-compile from Linux
to Windows with the Mingw compiler (for example) or alternatively
use a Cygwin environment.
</p>
<p>
To compile the SwarmPlugin you have to compile the whole VLC source tree. <br />
<tt> svn co http://svn.tribler.org/vlc/branches/vlc-0.9.5-win32-swarmplugin-diego-feb2009/ </tt> <br />
You can find the sources under vlc-0.9.5-win32-swarmplugin-diego-feb2009/vlc-0.9.5.
Compile it as you would compile VLC.
For details on how to build VLC please refer to the VLC documentation on
<a class="ext-link" href="http://wiki.videolan.org/Win32Compile"><span class="icon">​</span>How to build VLC for Windows</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since this task may be tricky we provide a script for creating a building environment,
patching VLC and compile the SwarmPlugin. As already stated the script is vlc_win32_setup.sh
and the patch file is vlc-0.9.5_swarm_plugin.patch. Create a new directory, place these files
in it, run the vlc_win32_setup.sh and follow the instructions.
</p>
<p>
Important: this procedure hasn't been tested on
a clean environment, you may find problems during
the configuration phase.
</p>
<h1 id="Howtoinstall">How to install</h1>
<p>
We provide you with a <a class="ext-link" href="http://svn.tribler.org/vlc/tags/vlc-0.9.5-swarmplugin-win32-feb2009/"><span class="icon">​</span>binary package</a>.
This package contains a vlc.win32.nsi NSIS script to build an autoinstaller.
Create your autoinstaller and run it. Remember to check the activex plugin as component to install and
change the destination directory to <tt> C:Program FilesSwarmPlugin </tt> (preferably).
Place the BG Process you built with the "dist" directory (read "How to build" section) preferably
under <tt> C:Program FilesSwarmPluginBGProcess </tt>.
Then create a Windows registry (with regedit) under <tt> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareSwarmPlugin </tt>
with BGProcessPath as key and the path where you copied the BG Process as value. Example: <br />
<tt> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareSwarmPlugin] </tt> <tt> BGProcessPath="C:Program FilesSwarmPluginBGProcessBackgroundProcess.exe" </tt>.<br />
</p>
<p>
Now you can try to open this <a class="ext-link" href="http://svn.tribler.org/abc/branches/diego/d08-09-11-swarmplayer-plugin-from-mainbranch-r8821/Tribler/IEPlugin/example_page.html"><span class="icon">​</span>page</a> with Internet Explorer.
</p>
<h1 id="AnInterestingFramework">An Interesting Framework</h1>
<p>
As it's possible to understand from the architecture description of
the Plug-in, the TriblerControl combined with the BG offers a
simple interface to the P2P core. Such framework would allow
developers to implement their own VOD software based on torrent/P2P
technology in a really simple way. Apart from the SwarmPlugin, other
possible uses could be:
</p>
<ul><li>A stand alone swarmplayer
</li><li>A Windows sidebar VOD widget
</li><li>P2P LIMO widgets
</li><li>...
</li></ul><p>
To implement such a feature you just have to include the TriblerControl
in your software in this way:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">/* Initialize TriblerControl */
TriblerControl * triblerControl = new TriblerControl();
triblerControl-&gt;startup();
/* Register callback functions */
triblerControl-&gt;regEventCB&lt; MyClass &gt;( EV_PLAY, &amp;myClassObj, &amp;MyClass::onPlayCmd );
triblerControl-&gt;regEventCB( EV_PAUSE,  &amp;myStaticFunction );
</pre><p>
register your callbacks for every event you want to handle:
</p>
<ul><li>EV_PLAY
</li><li>EV_PAUSE
</li><li>EV_RESUME
</li><li>EV_STOP
</li><li>EV_INFO
</li></ul><p>
<a class="missing" href="#"></a>
</p>
<h1 id="Todoandopenissuescurrentstatus">Todo and open issues (current status)</h1>
<ul><li>Perform building environment and building procedure.
</li><li>Create an installation script.
</li><li>Extend Systray icon interface and functionality.

<p>
The idea is to merge normal HTTP downloading with P2P.
The first time a user completes a normal HTTP download, he creates a
torrent out of it and notifies the tracker. When the second user downloads
the same resource through HTTP, a P2P plug-in integrated in the web browser
starts to look for other peers sharing the same content. At this point the resource
is going to be downloaded both through HTTP and <a class="wiki" href="BitTorrent.html">BitTorrent</a>. A service gives the
root-hash of the torrent providing a security hash-checking mechanism (see <a class="wiki" href="MerkleHashes.html">MerkleHashes</a> for more details).
