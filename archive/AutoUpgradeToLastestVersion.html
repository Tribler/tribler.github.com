	<section id="trac"><table><tr><td><h1 id="Automaticsoftwareupgrades">Automatic software upgrades</h1>
<p>
We have detected from crawls of the Tribler network
most of our users never upgrade Tribler. The majority
of our users are still using 3.6.0 and 3.7.0,
software that is over a year old. As of Nov. 2007 
less than 5% use the latest V4.1
</p>
<p>
A study found by Fabian given an insightfull look 
into the upgrade incentive problem, <a class="ext-link" href="http://cohesion.rice.edu/engineering/computerscience/TR/TR_Download.cfm?SDID=231"><span class="icon">â€‹</span>page 25 only</a>.
<em>We find that half of users are running software less
than three months old. Unfortunately, a third of Azureus 
users run software more than 6 months old despite an 
auto-update mechanism. Furthermore, about 5% of <a class="missing" href="#">BitComet</a>
users are running code over 18 months old. Clearly, no update 
can be expected to be universally adopted in a short timeframe.</em>
</p>
<p>
Upgrading and installing patches is a universal problem
in computer science, therefore it will take us time to fix
it. The auto-update mechanism should work similar to
the nice Firefox approach. Here is our ideal implementation :
</p>
<ul><li>Tribler developers test a Beta internally
</li><li>When Arno declares it stable it is deployed to our 50+ testers
</li><li>If deemed ready for release it is put on website
</li><li>When no issues are detected after at least 2 weeks we start the auto-upgrade
<ul><li>We hard-code in every Tribler peer a "software superpeer PermID"
</li><li>The <a class="wiki" href="BuddyCast.html">BuddyCast</a> profile of the software superpeer always contains the swarm with the latest downloads.
</li><li>While running <a class="wiki" href="BuddyCast.html">BuddyCast</a> a new release is automatically detected, for relevant OS.
</li><li>The software is automatically downloaded at low priority
</li><li>Upon next startup a single window appears, title "Software upgrade to Tribler V4.4"
</li><li>Pop-up Window text proposal :
<pre class="wiki">  '''Software upgrade to Tribler V4.4'''
  The Peer-to-Peer network is upgraded.
  The latest Tribler version has been downloaded is ready.
     [ ] Launch old version, get less performance
                     [ OK ]
</pre></li><li>Without any additional GUI questions the latest
version installs and starts (Similar to Firefox).
</li><li>Users can select the <em>launch old version</em> checkbox
<ul><li>This is shown as a simple <em>[ ]</em> checkbox
</li><li>This pop-up will show only once
</li><li>Users have to decline only once
</li><li>A pop-up appears again only if an ever newer version is available
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Comments">Comments</h2>
<p>
<em>Arno:</em> People may have problems with being forced to upgrade. IMHO they stick with an old version for a 
reason, e.g. because it works fine for them. I'd rather provide a strong incentive for them to upgrade.
Not obvious what that would be, apart from always saying "new version fixes major security bug" ;o)
</p>
<p>
<em>Jan David:</em> One feature I liked in other software is the 'A new version is available. Install / Skip / Later', after which "install" downloads and installs and asks for a restart, "skip" will not bug about this new version and "later" will ask me again next time. Full control, no hassle.
</p>
<p>
Threatening with worse performance is likely going to infuriate or alienate users. I would be pissed if my performance would be 'downgraded' even though I did not do anything. You can only boast about better performance with the new client, and -only- if its true. Most updates are bug fixes or new features, not extra performance on current features.
