</li></ul><p>
<a class="missing" href="#">Summary</a>
</p>
<h2 id="Orkut"><strong>Orkut</strong></h2>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Initially, it was developed by a software engineer of Google, Orkut Buyukkokten. 
From the time Google owned Orkut, it has been upgrading since. Over here, I am going to list down some of its features related to friendsâ management and privacy issues.
Since Gmail account is affiliated with Orkut, it provides a list of those who are in oneâs address book and not on the Orkut friendsâ list. Recently, Orkut has introduced a functionality to put oneâs email address in âFind Friendsâ section and it would show you a list of all those who arenât your friend, but added in your address book. âFind Friendsâ also has a combo box for Hotmail and AOL mail services. One could use these domains to see the same about friends.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scrapbook</strong><br />
The notion of scrapbook has been introduced in Orkut, which provides a platform to communicate through messages. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Chatting</strong><br />
Google talk can also be associated for live chatting service. It changes oneâs nick on getting online to show that one is available to chat. Currently, there is no other means to know who of your friends are online.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Friends</strong><br />
Friend categories are defined which makes it easier to classify friendâs group. The categories are:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy issues</strong><br />
Sometime ago, all scrapbooks were open to all. Anyone could read other's scrapbook, no matter she is a friend or not. Following list of things could be changed via settings<br />
</p>
<ul><li>Scrapbook<br />
</li><li>Photos<br />
</li><li>Videos<br />
</li><li>Testimonials<br />
</li><li>Feeds<br />
</li></ul><p>
Either they could be restricted to view by friends, or publicly by any member of Orkut. Only for scrapbook, one could also set it writeable for âfriends of friendsâ.
Feeds
Friendsâ updates could be seen by feeds, which tell any recent changes in oneâs profile to her friends. One could even make her feeds public, that is, whoever visits oneâs profile, would see all the recent changes made in it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mutual Friends</strong><br />
When a user visits profile of her friend, or even strangersâ, all mutual friends are shown under âmutual friendsâ tab just below friendsâ list, which shows how what friends are common in both friendsâ list.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communities</strong><br />
A user can join as many communities as she wants. All communities are related to a category, which could be, for example, religion, country, or culture. Every community has an owner, and can add up to 10 moderators for maintenance. Every community has âRelated Communitiesâ tabs as well in which owner can add whatever communities she thinks are related to her community.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Albums</strong><br />
Based on album notions, a user can create multiple albums of events.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Videos</strong><br />
Orkut allows adding videos from popular streaming websites as Youtube, and/or Google videos. Again there is no restriction on how many videos one could add.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal Information</strong><br />
From personal to professional information, all could be written down. Whatever one feeds, it would be visible to all the visitors. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Messages</strong><br />
<strong>Personal Messages</strong><br />
Depending upon the privacy settings, one could receive/send messages from/to friends and even from strangers (if setting is set to be public). Just like other message services, all sent items are also stored.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Community Messages</strong><br />
With the increasing popularity of Orkut, spammers have also exploited it as much as possible. In order to overcome this problem to some extent, Orkut has restricted community messages with over 1000 members, which means, one could only send messages to all community members if the total number of members is less than 1000. Otherwise, any user can send any information which may be of interest, or whatever she likes to share among her communityâs members.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Address book maintenance</strong><br />
It provides an easy method to download all the email addresses, along with their names, of oneâs friends in a CSV format. The procedure of it is explained in detail, just need a few clickings, and thatâs it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Invitation</strong><br />
There are two ways to invite oneâs friends to join Orkut. First is through address book of email accounts of Hotmail, AOL and Gmail, and the other one is by explicitly written comma separated list of email address.
One of the very useful functionalities which Orkut provides is that when user inputs her email address from Hotmail, AOL, or Gmail, it shows a complete list of people who are already member of Orkut, but not added to oneâs friendsâ list. One may add all the missing friends to her list, just be sending an add request, rather than inviting them to first become its member, and then become your friends.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Searching facility</strong><br />
Orkut provides a universal search option which may be used to search community, friends, or even topics inside a community. Just type in what you are searching for, and click on the tabs to filter it out for users, community or topics.
For member searching, an advanced mode is also provided, which could be used to filter out gender, location, religion, and lots of other features.
</p>
<h2 id="Facebook"><strong>Facebook</strong></h2>
<p>
<strong>Invitations</strong><br />
Like Orkut, Facebook also offers the functionality to invite oneâs friends through address book of email accounts in<br />
</p>
<ul><li>Hotmail/MSN<br />
</li><li>Gmail<br />
</li><li>Yahoo<br />
</li><li>AOL<br />
</li><li>Comcast.net<br />
</li><li>Bellsouth<br />
</li><li>Web.de<br />
</li><li>Gmx.de<br />
</li></ul><p>
A good thing for developing an invitee list is: Facebook tells how to create a list of contacts of<br />
</p>
<ul><li>Outlook<br />
</li><li>Outlook Express<br />
</li><li>Windows Address Book<br />
</li><li>Mozilla Thunderbird<br />
</li><li>Palm Desktop<br />
</li><li>Palm Desktop (vCard)<br />
</li><li>Entourage<br />
</li><li>Mac OS X Address Book<br />
</li><li><a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a><br />
</li></ul><p>
by giving explanation for each of them. A naÃ¯ve user can easily import all the contacts from these tools/services into Facebook by following the given instructions.
</p>
<p>
Or alternatively, one could send invitation via comma separated list of email addresses. 
Applications
</p>
<p>
<strong>Applications</strong><br />
One of the most important thing which different Facebook from rest of the social networking websites is its Applications, which motivated other social networking websites to adopt it via âOpen Socialâ, which is an Open API, and provides open platform to develop Applications for them. Facebook offers loads of applications to the users, which range from chatting to gaming applications. 
The major drawback, which I feel, is what applications are using what data of mine? Since most the applications here were developed by third party, Facebook doesnât take any responsibilities for their usage; neither does it have any check and balance over them. There could be some malicious applications exploiting usersâ data, but surprisingly, people donât care. And have been using them, either out of ignorance, or they really donât care.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Limited Profile</strong><br />
Unlike Orkut, Facebook provides an option to hide oneâs album and other personal details if one doesnât want to share with everyone, or even with a not-so-close friend who is added in oneâs friends list. On adding a friend, privacy details could be opted, allowing her friend to see either a complete or limited profile. These privacy settings for every friend could be changed afterwards as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Groups and Network</strong><br />
Groups are just like communities in Orkut, and a network represents an association/affiliation with an institute or a company. One could set any single network as her identity. It would be displayed whenever his profile becomes visible in a group/search or wherever her profile name appears. All the recent groups joined by friends, are displayed in a group section, which could be a motivation factor to her friends to join them as well.
Apart from a discussion board, Groups can have photos, videos, posted items to its page.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Feed</strong><br />
Whatever changes in oneâs profile, all updates are then supplied to oneâs all friends via feeds. It could be any addition of groups, change in picture, mood, or any other change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mutimedia</strong><br />
Unfortunately, there is no way to add videos to oneâs profile. Although, one could share videos through some applications, but she permanently canât associate them with her profile.
</p>
<h2 id="MySpace"><strong><a class="missing" href="#">MySpace</a></strong></h2>
<p>
<strong>Invitation</strong><br />
<a class="missing" href="#">MySpace</a> supports following email services <br />
</p>
<ul><li>Tiscali<br />
</li><li>Libero<br />
</li><li>Web.de<br />
</li><li>AOL<br />
</li><li>Yahoo[[BR]]
</li><li>Hotmail <br />
</li><li>GMX<br />
</li></ul><p>
<strong>Address book</strong><br />
The primary key, so to say, in <a class="missing" href="#">MySpace</a> is profileâs URL. It asks for a URL if a contact is to be added. One could also add people by giving their email address, full name, or display name. I couldnât find any way to download all the contacts. 
For privacy concerns, <a class="missing" href="#">MySpace</a> says that it doesnât store any login information of any email accounts.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a class="missing" href="#">Messages/Email</a></strong><br />
For communication between people, messages are used. And for this, instead of email address for identification, <a class="missing" href="#%C3%A2">MySpaceâ</a>s profile link is used in âToâ and âFromâ fields.
All relevant folders like âsent itemsâ and address book are part of this service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Videos</strong><br />
Just like youtube, and video.google.com, <a class="missing" href="#">MySpace</a> has its own service of videos, known as âMySpaceTVâ, which could directly be accessed publicly via
www.myspacetv.com
or with this URL
<a class="ext-link" href="http://vids.myspace.com/"><span class="icon">​</span>http://vids.myspace.com/</a>
once you are logged in.
One could add her own videos too. Just fill in some description about tags and category of the video you would like to upload, and then a pop-up window will appear. Browse through it and upload it. The supported formats are
.avi, .asf, .dv, .wmv, .mov, .qt, .3g2, .3gp, .3gp2, .3gpp, .gsm, .mpg, .mpeg, 
.mp4, .m4v, .mp4v, .cmp, .divx, .xvid, .264, .rm, .rmvb, .flv, .mkv, .ogm
And the maximum size of a video is 100 MB. One could either set its visibility public, or private.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Search</strong><br />
There are four categories in it, which are
<br />
<strong>1-        Find a Friend</strong><br />
This gives facility to find people either through their full name, display name, or even through their email addresses.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2-        Find a School</strong><br />
Giving schoolâs whereabouts, <a class="missing" href="#">MySpace</a> shows its page, if it exists. There a listing of all students/alumni which is displayed, and then one could filter out search according to a multitude of values, which could be gender, age, status, and others.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>3-        Search Profiles for People with Similar Personal Interests</strong><br />
Based on general interest, movies, books and music, people could be searched.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>4-        Search Profiles for People with Similar Career Interests</strong><br />
As for finding career related profiles, this functionality is used.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Chatting</strong><br />
<a class="missing" href="#">MySpace</a> has its own chat client, known as <a class="missing" href="#">MySpace</a> IM. One could send messages to friends, do voice chat. It is supported by Skype. Itâs a complete messenger, and needs an installation on oneâs computer to work.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Profile Customization</strong><br />
Perhaps, the most flexible and attracting feature which differentiates <a class="missing" href="#">MySpace</a> from other social networks is its customization of profiles. Every profile looks totally different. Users can change background image, add videos, songs, or even their blogs to their profile. It gives lot of flexibility to users, which makes it so popular.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Forum</strong><br />
On almost all the categories, topics can be created in it. There are already top categories of almost all topics have been created. 
</p>
<h2 id="LinkedIn"><strong><a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a></strong></h2>
<p>
It is also another social network website, but with a focus on professional contacts. Some of the key features of it are:<br />
</p>
<ul><li>Find potential clients, service providers, subject experts, and partners who come recommended<br />
</li><li>Be found for business opportunities<br />
</li><li>Search for great jobs<br />
</li><li>Discover inside connections that can help you land jobs and close deals<br />
</li><li>Post and distribute job listings<br />
</li><li>Find high-quality passive candidates<br />
</li><li>Get introduced to other professionals through the people you know<br />
</li></ul><p>
It has more than 20 million users of 150 different industries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Invitation</strong> <br />
As for building network from email accounts is concerned, <a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a> provides following email services for finding your contacts and/or inviting them to join it. The services are:<br />
</p>
<ul><li>Yahoo<br />
</li><li>Gmail<br />
</li><li>AOL<br />
</li></ul><p>
Also, comma separated values of email address could be supplied as well.  In detail, <a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a> also give directions to its member to import contacts from Outlook, the Palm Desktop, or ACT!, tab-separated files from the Palm Desktop, or vCard files.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Degrees</strong><br />
If someone visits other profiles, the degree of separation is displayed to show how that person is related to you, i.e. how far is she with your network. If two persons are connected directly, that would be 1st degree, and if a person visits another profile, which is in the connection of her friends, then that would be 2nd degree, and so on so forth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Messaging</strong><br />
The idea of â<a class="missing" href="#">InMailsâ</a> is introduced in it, which allows any <a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a> user to contact any other through message service. No matter if the receiver is in your network or not, you still can contact her. This feature is not free of cost, rather a bit expensive, I would say. It costs 10 dollars for each <a class="missing" href="#">InMail</a> message. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Group</strong><br />
The listing of groups is quite small, which covers a limited number of organizations. Also, apparently group search doesnât work at the moment; and gives the following error 
âThe groupâs directory is not currently open. We are working on creating a searchable directory for all groups. If there are groups you wish to join, you may click on the group logo from the profile of a group member and request to join.â
</p>
<p>
Which, definitely, is not acceptable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong><br /> 
This is what introduction is, according to <a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a> notions:
</p>
<p>
<em>Introductions let you contact users in your network, through the people you know. If you want to contact a <a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a> user who is two or three degrees away from you, you can request an introduction through one of your connections. Your connection will, in turn, decide whether to forward it on to the desired recipient (if in your 2nd degree) or to a shared connection (if in your 3rd degree)</em>. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Profile</strong><br />
If one views someoneâs profile, it also shows a list of profiles which were visited by others when the current one was viewed, under âViewers of this profile also viewed...â tab. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Recommendation</strong><br />
In general, recommendations tell how worthy a person is. Adopting the same concept, <a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a> provides a functionality to add recommendations on oneâs profile, by asking your current or former colleagues to recommend you. This whole process is started by writing an email to your colleague, who is already added in your connection, and then she will respond by writing you one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Network Updates</strong><br />
It gives feeds about your connectionsâ update. What connections have they developed, or what groups did they join in a past few days.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Just joined <a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a></strong><br />
This tells what colleagues and classmates have joined schools, universities, or offices in which one is affiliated, or had any affiliation. One could see their name, or even their profiles. And if found them interesting, can send an add request.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Searching</strong><br />
There are three categories in it<br />
<strong>-        Advanced people search</strong><br />
This search allows having a detailed set of parameters for location, industry, company information, key words, and other geographical and career oriented parameters. There is no required field. One could also restrict the search results to only her groups.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>-        Name Search</strong><br />
This is simpler search facility which requires inputting last name of the person to be searched.  Additionally, country and postal code could also be given.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>-        Reference Search</strong><br />
To find potential employer(s), company search along with date range gives a list of employee who could be contacted, provided that they could be reached. This functionality is also for paid users.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>Profile Completeness</strong><br />
When someone becomes a member of <a class="missing" href="#">LinkedIn</a>, and fills the required fields; after that, it shows what percentage of information has been provided, and what would make her profile 100 percent complete. Here is the list of items which make oneâs profile complete
</p>
<ul><li>Current position<br />
</li><li>Two past positions<br />
</li><li>Education<br />
</li><li>Profile summary<br />
</li><li>A profile photo<br />
</li><li>Specialties<br />
</li><li>At least three recommendations<br />
</li></ul><h2 id="Friendster"><strong>Friendster</strong></h2>
<p>
<strong>Message service</strong><br />
It contains message board with inbox and sent. Apart from that, there is a bulletin board as well, which could be used to ask questions, party announcements, or any other personal. This board would be visible to your friends, and your fans.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Feeds</strong><br />
All friendsâ update is shown. What changes have they made in their profile, when were they online, and what friends have they met.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Search</strong><br />
There are six categories of searching, which are <br />
</p>
<ul><li>       <strong>Search</strong><br />
</li></ul><p>
This is an advanced level search which allows finding people by their location, status, gender, or by their favorite movies, books, and so on.<br />
</p>
<ul><li>       <strong>Find by name</strong><br />
</li></ul><p>
This allows searching people either with their name or emailing address. Location could also be supplied to narrow down search results.<br />
</p>
<ul><li>       <strong>College search</strong><br />
</li></ul><p>
It contains a very limited number of colleges of selected countries. One could search people by supplying a date range, and degree level.<br />
</p>
<ul><li>       <strong>School search</strong><br />
</li></ul><p>
Same functionality as college search<br />
</p>
<ul><li>       <strong>Web search</strong><br />
</li></ul><p>
Google search<br />
</p>
<ul><li>       <strong>Search Groups</strong><br />
</li></ul><p>
Group search by their names could be searched. And it could be further filtered out by groupsâ categories and location.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>Applications</strong><br />
Just like Facebook, Friendster also supports applications. It is also part of <a class="missing" href="#">OpenSocial</a> project as well. The broad categories of applications are:<br />
</p>
<ul><li>Slideshows and Photos<br /> 
</li><li>Just For Fun <br />
</li><li>Entertainment <br />
</li><li>Games <br />
</li><li>News and Information <br />
</li><li>Sports <br />
</li><li>TV Shows <br />
</li><li>Video <br />
</li><li>Music<br />
</li></ul><p>
A very detailed documentation for developers is also provided
</p>
<p>
<strong>Profile Customization</strong><br />
One could add videos, photos, and skins from the set of almost 40. Also, one could add reviews, blog entries, music, featured friends (fans), or any topic to a bulletin board. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a class="missing" href="#">Invitation/Address</a> book</strong><br />
It also provides service to fetch email address from popular email websites, which are:<br />
</p>
<ul><li>Yahoo<br />
</li><li>Hotmail<br />
</li><li>gmail<br />
</li><li>aol<br />
</li><li>sina.com<br />
</li><li>163.com<br />
</li><li>126.com<br />
</li><li>Daum.net<br />
</li><li>qq.com<br />
</li></ul><p>
Apart from that, members could also supply a list of email address, or a file containing comma separated list of email address.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy concerns</strong><br />
It allows a profile to be either limited, that means only oneâs friends can see the full version, or it can be public, that mean any friendster member can go through it. Also, it provides a facility to anonymously browse profile, but you wonât be able to see who visited your profile as well. Or you could be known in otherâs recent visitors list, and can see who were the last 100 (maximum that is) people visited your profile. One could even block a person as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Groups</strong><br />
One could join as many groups as she wants. There is a huge list of group categories, ranging from religion, culture to science. There are two kinds of groups:
Public:
Anyone can join them without ownerâs approval.
Private
One needs group ownerâs approval in order to become its member.
